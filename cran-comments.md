## Resubmission

Resubmission because a dependency that was going to be archived was fixed, so I've re-implemented that dependency.

## Test environments
* local macOS install, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs, ERRORs, WARNINGs.

## Downstream dependencies
There is one downstream dependency for this package, misty, but no functionality is changed.
